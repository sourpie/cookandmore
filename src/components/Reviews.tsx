      It was a super amazing Experience with wonderful hosts ‚Äì Roopak & Nidhi. They took great care of me, explaining a lot about Delhi & India while we cooked a 6-course delicious meal. They have a beautiful home and I felt very comfortable at their home during the Tour. It was a great opportunity for me to see a local home and speak to Hosts about everything I wanted to know in general about India & Hindu faith & customs. We had a fun Number Game during the Tour through which I learnt so much! The Hosts are extremely hospitable and the communication with them was excellent even before the Experience. I highly recommend this 10-Star Experience by Roopak & Nidhi to all visitors going to Delhi ‚Äì should not be missed.

      Amazing experience, a great way to really be involved with Hindu & Indian culture. They are so welcoming into their home. Great communication straight away. They make you feel safe & recommend for solo women travellers too. It‚Äôs a husband & wife & sometimes their kids are there too depending on schedule. They were so accomodating to us as we booked really last minute & they sorted it out for us. Plus they waited for over an hour as we got delayed. Food was AMAZING. Cooking experience super fun. You learn a lot as it‚Äôs not just cooking but learning some hindu & talking and asking questions. If you want to learn more about the culture then do this!

      Nidhi and Roopak were super hosts. I felt really at home with them. They‚Äôre so warm people. The cooking experience was great and a good dive into homemade daily Indian food. And the conversations about Indian culture were super helpful to better understand such a crazy and colourful country like India. And the tips to Delhi were super helpful. Really recommend!
